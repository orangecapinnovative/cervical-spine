# Cervical Spine

A seamless port from [Spinal](https://github.com/jitta/spinal) broker architecture to broker-less DNS-based microservice architecture

This library is used as an intention to remove broker from the system and use HTTP call to DNS-based services instead. Common use-case is [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Just remove spinal and install cervical-spine instead.

```
npm install cervical-spine
```

Then, replace each `require('spinal')` to `require('cervical-spine')`.

## How it works

Cervical Spine has same API calls with Spinal. For example, when you call `user.get` with an argument `{"id":"1"}` it will send a HTTP POST request to `http://user:7557/` with data `{"name":"get","data":{"id":1}}`.

You can also specify host prefix and suffix by assigning env variable `SPINAL_HOSTNAME_PREFIX` and `SPINAL_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX`. Alternatively passing an option `hostname_prefix` and `hostname_prefix` when initializing a spinal node. For example, having `SPINAL_HOSTNAME_PREFIX=production- SPINAL_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX=-service` will make a call to `http://production-user-service:7557/`

Caching still works by passing `redis` options at node initialization instead of broker in Spinal.

Unlike broker-based approach, this approach introduce new challenge, that is local development. The port would collide if more than one service is run at the same time. Port map is introduced to solve the problem. Simply specify option `port_map` while initializing a node like this:

```javascript
  spinal = new Spinal('spinal://127.0.0.1:7557', {
    namespace: 'nock_node',
    port_map: {
      nock_node: 7557,
      bunny: 7658,
    }
  })
```
When running with `NODE_ENV=development`, port map will be used. Each service will create a HTTP server using thier port assigned in port map without colliding. Alternatively, an env variable of `SPINAL_PORT_MAP` can also be used (encoded in JSON format).
